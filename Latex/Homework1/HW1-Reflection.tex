I found the most challenging part of the homework to have the triangle actually change colors.
I initially had assigned colorValue with the idea in mind that it would change the color of the triangle, and all I needed to do was update its value.
When this proved to not be true, I was confused and logged the values to see that it was in fact changing.
When the changes were visible but still no color changes on the triangle were visible I was perplexed.
Afterwards, I realized I didn't update the VBO, meaning that the changes weren't being rendered.
After adding the line to update the buffer, there were still no changes and I was stumped for a long time.
Then I had the idea to manually update the values within vertices to the new value of colorValue.
To me this seemed redundant, since vertices was defined with colorValue and I assumed it was dynamically referenced.
As it turns out however, this was untrue!
Vertices was defined and its values were statically defined, so when I manually input the new values for the color, the code worked.

I would say that I learned that I need to explicitly define changes to all associated parts.
Ranging from definitions of variables like in vertices, to changing the values within the variables, and finally updating the buffer to draw the new image.
