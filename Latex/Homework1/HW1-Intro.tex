This document descibes the architecture and design for the first assignment with OpenGL.
The objective with this assignment was to create a triangle that oscillates between colored and non-colored.

There are two windows that are created when the program is run:
window 1 which contains the triangle, and window 2 which is the console output for the program.
Window 2 displays nothing until window 1 is closed.
