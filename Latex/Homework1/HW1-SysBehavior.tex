\section{System Behavior}

The use case view is the prime motivator for the System Behavior.
This is because the program is simple with no complex components.

In Figure \ref{Fig:Fig1}, the right triangle has a white outline and black fill to demonstrate that the triangle exists, but lacks color.
When the program is run however, the triangle loses color until it is not visible anymore.
